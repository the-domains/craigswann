# Creative Cross-Pollination

Creativity is not picky. It spans across every art, business and industry. Across all languages, locations and walks of life. Creativity is a primal element of humanity - existing everywhere you look. Too often, however, much of the inspiration that we may look for comes from the same vertical we are in. We silo ourselves off from much of the world's creativity and how it can apply to us. If we are a furniture maker it is likely that we look to trade magazines, exhibitions and the latest up and comers to see what is fresh, what is happening, and what is new with creativity in our field. There is nothing wrong with this. IT's an important part of running a business and staying on top of things. But is misses the larger opportunity. The opportunity of differentiation.

Sometimes looking at completely different industries, forms of art and businesses we can get the most creative ideas. Thinking outside the box of our own world. Opportunities exist to spot creativity in a host of other places. From nature, architecture, painting, fashion, design. Everywhere there are people expressing creativity through a myriad of different forms and substances. Step outside and look at other industries, at other products and designs with a fresh eye. Problem solving is universal, but it takes on many different forms.

Attend events from worlds that you never enter. Meet, introduce and spend time with people that work in completely unrelated industries. Listen to them. Absorb what they say. Act as though you are an apprentice or someone wanting to enter their field of expertise. Listen to how they approach design challenges. How do they problem solve? What is their concept of creativity? These conversations will be enlightening. They will open up new connections to thought and creativity that you could never possibly connect stuck in the tunnel vision of your own life. Embrace opportunities to meet people outside your sphere of influence. Ask questions. Listen.

This creative cross-pollination will germinate new and exciting connections and ideas that you will have not thought of before. They will send you off excited about what you are doing. Providing new insights into your own experiences and new outlets for your creativity.

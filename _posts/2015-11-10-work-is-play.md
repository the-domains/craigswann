# Work is Play

Living in the digital age we have blurred the boundaries between the analog and the digital. between the work and the play. Our lives are full of multi-tasking and the definitions of work and play have been somewhat entangled.

The way that we choose to look at our surroundings or our environment dictates the experience that we are going to have. It's simple. Expect a negative outcome and it's yours. Look for the good stuff and you will find it. Our perceptions are really filters that take a near infinite number of stimuli and syphons it down into the fragments of our experience that support our intentions. Work is work or work is play. It may seem like a stupidly simple and slight notion, but bear with me. The framing of our situation sets the tone for our brains to deal on a subconscious level with our environment. Have you ever gotten yourself into a sweat and nervous over a presentation, a meeting or some experience you just had to take part in. The thoughts that we feed ourselves become the fuel to our emotion during these moments. Feed thoughts of failure and insecurity and how on earth can you expect to accomplish the opposite? When you haven't even prepped yourself and your mind to a state of confidence or success?

It is this prime functioning nature of thought, action and result which is what we need to consider when choosing to look at our lives a little differently.

Let's face it - when we are doing something we love, something we get lost in - time evaporates, thoughts of doubt don't creep in - only answers to how can we continue doing what we enjoy. This is how we should consider looking at 'work'.

How many of us "go to work" each day? What the heck does that mean? like work is some magical place or destination that we go to. What work really is - is where we spend the majority of our waking hours. Sure, some people may be involved with 'work' that moves them around, but for a majority of people - work is a destination. a static location. it is also, of course, a state of mind.

[Working for the Weekend][0]

How many of you can remember the Loverboy smash hit of the 80's Working for the weekend? hopefully not too many - however How many people do you know that spend their lives doing this? working for the weekend. 5 days of monotonous soul-crushing work being unleashed on two days of life-living - and for many how many of these days involve over-indulging as almost a coping mechanism?

What kind of culture is that? If you can see this out there, you are seeing the realization of "industry". The oil of the unstoppable machinery. But what if Work was play?

What if we decided to re-evaluate the biggest chunk of our existence and think about ways we could create the most playful life for ourselves? If you are fortunate to be already working in a field or area in which you truly derive satisfaction then life is good and it's only easier to make it better. If, however, we find ourselves at a "job", or a career that doesn't take us where we ultimately want to go what then?

What do you love to do more than anything? What activities bring you the most joy? This is a deceptively easy \*and\* difficult question. Do you have natural tendencies or inclinations towards certain areas? Do you have natural abilities that you have nurtured, take care of and get satisfaction from? What makes you smile? What sort of accomplishments or aspirations have tugged at you? Explore these ideas.

There are a couple of helpful ways to think about these types of questions. Often the idea of imagining something that you would happily spend your life doing - with no compensation. That's right. no money. Just knowing that you could pursue whatever it is that you wanted. If you can answer then you are well on your way to transforming the stale notion of work into the creative power of play.

When we are consumed with what we love, the noise begins to settle. The incessant questions that rattle in our minds, the distractions, the things that we think about as simple diversions from the task at hand. Diversions from something we are not passion about. But when we are completely absolved in what we are doing - our mind quiets. Doubts are removed and replaced by thoughts of curiosity, of improvement. Never changing state or connection with what we are focused on. We can see the final results. we better know what we want to accomplish and not only know that we can accomplish it, but that we want to.

Remember playing as a child? What did we do? Well, if like me you were born before computers had entirely taken over our lives then you will more than likley remember the power of imagination. The joy in creating something from nothing. Where a simple branch become an entirely different thing depending on it's shape, how you chose to hold it, where you were, who you were with. Our creativity had the power to transform simple objects into magical machines, cardboard boxes into palaces and trees into fortresses. and when we did that we could become lost in the world of our own creation. We still can, but we've had layers of programming and conditioning from media and markets and politics to religion. Every one has an agenda and we - to some extent - can be led to live within a very narrow set of experiential parameters. If we aren't conscious of it.

If you can imagine the thing(s) that makes you most happy when you are doing it whether it is cooking, building, an artistic pursuit, exploring a topic, being consumed in an activity - as soon as you think about this - chances are your mind has already jumped to a number of sub-activities and things about what it is you enjoy.

Our minds survive on what we feed it. Our thoughts are the fuel. It does not matter what question you ask yourself - your mind will generate answers. That's how it works. The power lies in the questions we ask and the thoughts we maintain.

By doing what we love we allow our mind to feed off of innovation, happiness and productiveness. We create a feedback loop where creation drives reaction which creation thrives on. Our own little self-sustaining system of happiness. Decide what we take pleasure in and do it. Now, of course someone will allows say I take the greatest pleasure in eating chocolates and watching reruns of 80's shows. Well then - there's an excellent opportunity to be the world's foremost expert on shows from the 80's and chocolate to boot. In all seriousness if that's what it was then by simply taking those interests and transforming that knowledge and insight into a portal for the world to seek and get information they are looking for - that time that is being 'spent' can be 'invested' into a way that could legitimately be monetized. Of course, again, this is an extreme example, but still yet in the extreme it is always possible to find a way to make it your life.

When work is play. Life is play. In a 24 hour day - assuming we sleep for 8 - we then spend 50% of our life - at minimum - at "work". What work means to us should be a pretty important thing. We spend more time with the people we work with than our own families and loved ones. How's that grab ya?! You can begin to see the importance of how we perceive work and our lives as we base and make decisions.

A job turns into a career and a career turns into a life. That's the destiny train most of the world rides - if they are lucky even. Many people will never find themselves in a career even, but for those that have spent their youth preparing for one there is a good chance you are in one now. It happens easily, and what is the bigger concern is where you end up as you progress through your career. The longer the time we spend at any one company the more we know the people there, the system and workings of the company, procedures, the clients, the process. We become understanding and in so doing become valuable to an organization the longer that we are there. However the more that company may rely on us the more we may need to rely on the company. During this period of time we've progressed, received raises, salaries and positions. We may have bought a home, put down a mortgage, perhaps gotten married and started a family. We are living in a condition of comfort. [THe][0][NEcessity][0] of existence in these situations provides a comforting stability between work and life. As we become more and more dependent on keeping the status quo (if not improving for family) we rely on the consistent pay checks - and ideally raises. This reliance can quickly lead to the making of unhealthy decisions in the bigger picture in lieue of maintaining the comfort level that has been achieved.

This destiny train can become a trap to many. Past the point of return down a path they were never fully committed to. This is something we want to try and avoid - all by truly deciding and committing to what it is that we want to do. Dealing with the fear of change (if it exists - and it shouldn't it's exciting!) comes later. First is the decision to decide to turn work into play.

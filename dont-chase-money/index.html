It's like the never-ending story - the finish line most people keep sprinting for, despite our knees sometimes buckling. It's too easy in a culture of consumerism and consumption to not just chase money from some personal desire, but more and more out of a pure sense of need. society and media constantly plant images, forcing us to compare ourselves to others and more than naught - simply to a fabricated and imaginary lifestyle and society. The more that society is cocooned off accepting reality through the programming that comes through television and mass media, the more delusional our own understanding of what is going on is.</p><p>Money is not the end all be all. Think about it. How does it make any sense to be put in the grave with lots of money sitting in the bank? How can that be any measure of success? When money is an exchange for our life - our time and our resources - how can it make sense to be sitting on a pile of it when we die?? This just means that we traded in our life, our time, our experiences for something that never got cashed in. That's selling ourselves more than a little short.</p><p>The ironic part is that doing just the opposite is likely to create the most value. Using our energy to chase after money puts us constantly in a state of reaction. Constantly responding and acting based on external stimuli. Following markets, trends, opportunities as they present themselves and moving back and forth in chase of something that is imaginary. Listen - movie isn't even real. It's a concept that our society is based on - nothing more. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that money is not necessary to survive in the modern western world, but I am saying that we don't have to chase after it.</p><p>The problem with chasing after anything is that we become lost in the hunt. Lost in the race of reactionary responses, constantly looking for, seeking and running after something illusive and imaginary. The real secret is letting money come to you. But how do we accomplish this? Do what you love. Passion. Most people *are* chasing money, caught up in the game of commerce and lose sight of what really matters to them. Their happiness. In the end, yes money can buy things that we might think bring us happiness - but it's an illusion. True happiness comes from inside. It comes from how we feel and we can create that feeling far easier than buying things can. Sure, it takes a new state of mind and determination - but in the end it's much easier.</p><p>When you are doing what you love, creating and working on things that bring you pleasure you tap into the power of passion. Where time is irrelevant and all that matters is quality and the relationship that you have to what you are doing. This unique approach to creation creates product and service far beyond that which is done purely for profit making. Consider Apple. Now, surely they are one of the most successful companies in the world and by all means they seek to earn as much profit from what they are doing, but compare them to other computer or hardware manufacturers. All other products are mere mediocre compared to the craftsmanship that goes into every Apple product. Why? Because it stems from a passion - a passion to create something on their own terms. A vision of the future that is unique and personal and with no bending, faltering or compromising on that vision. As a result? The most successful digital and computing products the world has ever seen.</p><p>Follow your heart. Follow your passion. It will lead to your best work. Work that you are proud of. Work that others will admire and want to be associated with. Let the money find you. In the long run it's not only easier, but much more satisfying.</p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="23"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="24"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="25"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="26"><span data-reactid="27"><!-- react-empty: 28 --><h2 data-reactid="29"><a data-reactid="30">CraigSwann</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="31"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="32"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="33"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="34"></div></section></div></div>
